# Module 3: Basic RTOS Environment Sensing

> This version of the project requires two [SN74HC595](https://www.ti.com/product/SN74HC595) cascaded together.

This is an extension of the original class code that takes it further with cascaded shift registers allowing us to write using the 8-bit mode for the LCD.

## Tasks & Objectives

Taking the environmental sensing from `module-2` and applying the basic RTOS operations `Threads` (Tasks) to control all peripherals.

# Module 3: Bare-metal Environment Sensing

> This version of the project requires two [SN74HC595](https://www.ti.com/product/SN74HC595) cascaded together.

This is an extension of the original class code that takes it further with cascaded shift registers allowing us to write using the 8-bit mode for the LCD.

## Tasks & Objectives

Addition of STM IKS4A1 Extension board for basic Bare-metal environmental sensing to show **humidity** and **temperature** on the LCD. Backlight is fixed to static PWM duty cycle and ambient light detection to be re-introduced in `module-3` with the RTOS.
